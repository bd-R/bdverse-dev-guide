# Git & GitHub Strategy

## Our needs

Synchronizing the perpetual development and releases of many R packages is challenging; nevertheless, when they have a strict hierarchical dependency architecture. Fully embracing [Git best practices](https://happygitwithr.com/) is crucial to our well being (i.e., crucial to project longevity).

## Our Git strategy
[**Under Construction**]

Having a clear, robust, consistent, and well-documented branching strategy is the key. We are more or less following the [Gitflow Workflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model):

## Adjustments to working with GitHub
[**Under Construction**]

The [Github Flow](https://medium.com/@patrickporto/4-branching-workflows-for-git-30d0aaee7bf#a5c2) is somewhat different...

### `master` is the defult branch, why?
